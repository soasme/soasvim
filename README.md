soasvim
=======

a quickly installed vim plugin set

### install
if you want to use soasvim, just type these commands:

    git clone https://github.com/soasme/soasvim.git ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    sh install.sh



### maps
I map some stupid error like:
    :VS -> :vs
    :WQ -> :wq
and some convenient binds like:
    <C-H> -> <C-W>h, ( and also j,k,l ), it can jump fast.
you can also type ; to replace :, it's cool.

### NERDTree
<C-e> or ,,e to see a file-tree command.

### EasyMotion
,f<word> ,F<word> to jump to the word quikly.
,b 
,w
,j
,k

### Mini Buffer Explorer
It's on the top. use <tab> to change the current edited file.
