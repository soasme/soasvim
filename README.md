soasvim
=======

a quickly installed vim plugin set

### install
if you want to use soasvim, just type these commands:

    git clone https://github.com/soasme/soasvim.git ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    sh install.sh



### maps
I map some stupid error like:
    :VS -> :vs
    :WQ -> :wq
and some convenient binds like:
    <C-H> -> <C-W>h, ( and also j,k,l ), it can jump fast.
you can also type ; to replace :, it's cool.

### NERDTree
see a file-tree command:
    <C-e> or ,,e

### EasyMotion
jump to the word quikly:
    ,f<word> ,F<word>
    ,b 
    ,w
    ,j
    ,k

### Mini Buffer Explorer
It's on the top. use tab to change the current edited file.

### snipMate
a snip like textmate
type
    for<tab> 
    it will change to 
    for xxx in xxx:
        # content

### NERDCommenter
use v to choose lines, and then
    ,c<space>   it will comment the line.
    ,ci         it will uncomment the line.
